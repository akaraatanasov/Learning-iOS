# What’s new in Swift 5.0?

This is an Xcode playground that demonstrates the new features introduced in Swift 5.0: 

* Raw strings
* A standard `Result` type
* Customizing string interpolation
* Dynamically callable types
* Handling future enum cases
* Flattening nested optionals resulting from `try?`
* Checking for integer multiples
* Transforming and unwrapping dictionary values with `compactMapValues()`

This is designed to complement my existing article [What’s New in Swift 5.0](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/126/whats-new-in-swift-5-0).
