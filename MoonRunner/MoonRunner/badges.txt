We're curious people. Look back over history, people have put their lives at stake to go out and explore. We believe in what we're doing. Now it's time to go.\" -Eileen Collins, NASA Space Shuttle Commander","imageName":"atmosphere.jpg","distance":"804.672","space_distance":"100000"},{"id":"3","name":"The Moon","information":"The Moon rotates about its axis in the same time it takes to orbit the Earth, so the same face is always turned toward us. The side facing away is sometimes called the \"dark side,\" but actually it is illuminated just as often-- it's being lit up when the side facing us appears dark. Sorry, Pink Floyd.","imageName":"moon.jpg","distance":"1609.344","space_distance":"384400000"},{"id":"4","name":"Earth's Magnetotail","information":"Yes, a \"magnetotail\" is a thing. Earth's \"magnetosphere\" is the volume around it controlled by its magnetic field. It's always getting hit by the \"solar wind,\" a strong stream of charged particles from the Sun. So towards the Sun, the sphere gets compressed down, and away it is skewed into a long tail.","imageName":"magnetotail.png","distance":"2414.016","space_distance":"6300000000"},{"id":"5","name":"Mars","information":"Often called the Red Planet because of all the iron oxide (rust) on its surface.

The rover tweets photos and more @MarsCuriosity.","imageName":"mars.jpg","distance":"3218.688","space_distance":"57600000000"},{"id":"6","name":"Phobos","information":"Phobos is the larger and closer of Mars' two moons. It orbits so close to the planet that it moves around Mars faster than Mars rotates. So if you live on Mars, it looks like Phobos rises in the west and then sets in the east just over 4 hours later. And this happens twice a day!","imageName":"phobos.jpg","distance":"4023.36","space_distance":"57609376000"},{"id":"7","name":"Deimos","information":"Deimos is the outer moon of Mars. Its two largest craters are Swift and Voltaire, named after the 18th century authors of \"Gulliver's Travels\" and \"Candide.\" In his travels, Gulliver met fictional Laputans who had \"discovered\" that Mars had two moons. The book was written fifty years BEFORE real-life humans actually discovered them!","imageName":"deimos.jpg","distance":"4828.032","space_distance":"57623463200"},{"id":"8","name":"The Asteroid Belt","information":"The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter is spread over so much space that it's actually mostly empty-- no need to dodge rocks like in the movies. When first discovered in the early 1800's, asteroids were hard to distinguish from stars. Thus the name aster-oid, meaning \"star-like.\" We now know they aren't stars at all, but the name's stuck.","imageName":"asteroid_belt.png","distance":"5632.704","space_distance":"159000000000"},{"id":"9","name":"Ceres","information":"Ceres is the largest asteroid in the belt between Mars and Jupiter. It's classified as a \"dwarf planet,\" like Pluto. It very likely has an ocean of liquid water under its surface, which may harbor life. NASA's \"Dawn\" probe is expected to arrive there in February 2015, so we'll know more then.","imageName":"ceres.jpg","distance":"6437.376","space_distance":"255000000000"},{"id":"10","name":"Jupiter","information":"The largest planet in the Solar System, named after the ancient Roman king of gods.

There's no proof yet, but there could be life in its under-ice ocean. The 2013 film \"Europa Report\" provided a fictional possibility of that discovery, and the European Space Agency's \"JUICE\" probe will provide a first close look when it gets there in 2030.","imageName":"europa.jpg","distance":"8851.392","space_distance":"629284493300"},{"id":"13","name":"Ganymede","information":"The third \"Galilean\" moon of Jupiter, Ganymede, is the largest moon in the solar system and has a larger diameter than the planet Mercury.

A 2003 NASA report proposed a surface base on Callisto. With its low levels of radiation and geological stability, it could be a sort of refueling waystation for vessels headed toward other moons of Jupiter or farther into the outer Solar System.","imageName":"callisto.jpg","distance":"11265.408","space_distance":"630496293300"},{"id":"15","name":"Saturn","information":"Saturn is perennial favorite because of its famous rings. The rings are made of countless small, orbiting particles of water, ice, and trace rocky material. Confused by the way they seemed to disappear when oriented directly at Earth, Galileo once wondered \"has Saturn swallowed his children?\" This referenced the ancient Roman god Saturn's bad habit of eating his children to prevent them from overthrowing him.","imageName":"saturn.jpg","distance":"12874.752","space_distance":"1283166048000"},{"id":"16","name":"Mimas","information":"Mimas is the closest of Saturn's major moons. It's the smallest known astronomical body that is round due to self-gravitation. Mimas has been noted for its resemblance to the Death Star in the film \"Star Wars.\" But anyone flying close will note: \"that's no space station... it's a moon!\"","imageName":"mimas.jpg","distance":"14484.096","space_distance":"1283351048000"},{"id":"17","name":"Enceladus","information":"Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, has ice volcanoes at its South Pole.

But in 2010, the Cassini probe found no evidence and it now seems unlikely. Still, the discovery of some mysterious blue ice along Rhea's equator keeps the possibility open.","imageName":"rhea.jpg","distance":"20921.472","space_distance":"1283693156000"},{"id":"21","name":"Titan","information":"By far the largest moon of Saturn, Titan is the only place in the Solar System other than Earth with stable bodies of surface liquid (it has methane rivers and lakes) as well as the only other place with a nitrogen-rich atmosphere (it has a climate complete with wind and methane rain).","imageName":"titan.jpg","distance":"22530.816","space_distance":"1284387918000"},{"id":"22","name":"Iapetus","information":"Iapetus is the farthest major moon of Saturn and has two unique features. First, it has two huge sections of different colors: one dark brown and one bright gray. The two colors interlock like the surface of a tennis ball. Second, it has a long ridge along its equator that makes the moon look a little like a walnut shell. So to recap: Iapetus is the walnut tennis ball moon.","imageName":"iapetus.jpg","distance":"24140.16","space_distance":"1286726868000"},{"id":"23","name":"Uranus","information":"Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. OK. Let's have a talk about its name. Astronomers usually stress the first syllable (EWR-i-nis), but stressing the second (ew-RAY-nes) is OK too. You should also ask the nearest 8-year-old which one they prefer.","imageName":"uranus.jpg","distance":"25749.504","space_distance":"2725563622000"},{"id":"24","name":"Miranda","information":"Miranda, smallest and innermost of Uranus's five major moons, was named after the character from Shakespeare's \"The Tempest.\" It has very rough, broken terrain on its icy surface. Which may be because of... ice volcanoes!","imageName":"miranda.jpg","distance":"27358.848","space_distance":"2725693012000"},{"id":"25","name":"Ariel","information":"Ariel is the second-closest of Uranus's major moons. Because it is on its side as it rotates the Sun, it is subject to an extreme seasonal cycle. This also means Ariel's poles see permanent daylight or night lasting for half a Uranian year (42 Earth years). Winter is coming, indeed.","imageName":"ariel.jpg","distance":"28968.192","space_distance":"2725754642000"},{"id":"26","name":"Umbriel","information":"Umbriel is the darkest of the Uranian moons, and imaging of its surface is still of fairly low resolution.
